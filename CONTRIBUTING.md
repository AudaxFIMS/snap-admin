Hi and thanks for your interest in contributing to SnapAdmin. 

At this moment, I am not accepting pull requests for this repo. Processing PRs requires a lot of time, not just to review
them but also to maintain them in the future. Although this is the main reason, I also want to maintain sole ownership of
the code for possible licensing reasons.

You can still help a lot by using SnapAdmin and reporting any issue you find. Features/improvements ideas are also
very welcome. If you are already a user, you can start by contributing a data point to #19, as it helps me understand how
SnapAdmin is used and by who.

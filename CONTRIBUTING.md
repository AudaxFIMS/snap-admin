Hi and thanks for your interest in contributing to SnapAdmin. 

At this moment, I am not fully focused on this project and I don't have enough time to review big PRs. 
Thus, I cannot guarantee that I will review and/or accept your contribution. If it's a small/simple PR,
it's more likely it will get accepted.

You can still help a lot by using SnapAdmin and reporting any issue you find. Features/improvements ideas are also
very welcome. If you are already a user, you can start by contributing a data point to #19, as it helps me understand how
SnapAdmin is used and by who.
